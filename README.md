Transformer" and "LLM" are often used interchangeably, but they aren't the same. Understanding the difference is key to understanding how modern AI works.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the core concepts:

1. The Transformer: The Engine of Modern LLMs
The "secret sauce" behind most modern LLMs is the Transformer architecture. It was introduced in a 2017 paper, "Attention Is All You Need."

Interestingly, it was originally designed for machine translation (e.g., English to German), not the creative text generation we see today.

Demystifying GPT: A Journey from Transformers to Emergent AI

Understanding how Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) work is essential in today's AI landscape. It's not just about using ChatGPT; it's about grasping the foundational concepts that drive these powerful models.

The Conceptual Roadmap to Building a Large Language Model
To truly understand Large Language Models (LLMs), you must go beyond just using them and learn the fundamental theory behind their creation. The entire process of building an LLM from scratch can be broken down into three theoretical stages.

Stage 1: Understanding the Basic Mechanism
This is the foundational blueprint. Before any training occurs, you must define the components of the model and its data.

Data Preparation & Sampling: This involves the theories of Tokenization (converting text to numerical units), Vector Embedding (mapping those units into a high-dimensional space where "similar" tokens are mathematically close), and Data Batching (the strategy for feeding data to the model in efficient chunks).
